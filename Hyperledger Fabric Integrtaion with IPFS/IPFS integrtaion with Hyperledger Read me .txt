IPFS-Hyperledger integration
This is a Python script which adds a given Research Object to IPFS and stores the hash into Hyperledger based blockchain using explorer -rest-server and ipfshttpclient (or py-ipfs-api : https://github.com/ipfs/py-ipfs-api).

Lets say you have a fileTejamedicalencrypt.txt in the same directory as the add-to-ipfs.py and would like to add this file to IPFS and store the resulting hash into the block chain which is currently using the Journal of Research Objects BNA file (jro@0.0.1.bna).
